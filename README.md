# 📘 Day 14: Scope | HackerRank 30 Days of Code

This repository contains the Python solution for **Day 14** of the HackerRank 30 Days of Code challenge, which focuses on the concept of **Scope** and finding the **maximum absolute difference** in an array using object-oriented programming.

## 🚀 Challenge Summary

You are given a class `Difference` and an array of integers. 

Your task is to compute the **maximum absolute difference** between any two elements in the array and store it in the `maximumDifference` variable.

## 📝 Problem Statement

Complete the `Difference` class by:

- Creating a constructor that stores the array as a private instance variable `__elements`.

- Implementing the method `computeDifference()` which calculates the **maximum absolute difference** between any two elements and stores the result in `maximumDifference`.

## ✅ Constraints
    
    - `1 ≤ N ≤ 10`
      
    - `1 ≤ elements[i] ≤ 100` where `0 ≤ i < N`

## 🔢 Sample Input
    
    3
    
    1 2 5

## ✅ Sample Output

    4

## 💡 Explanation

The array contains: [1, 2, 5]  

Possible absolute differences:

      - |1 - 2| = 1
        
      - |1 - 5| = 4
         
      - |2 - 5| = 3  

The **maximum absolute difference** is **4**.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Variable Scope
  
- Encapsulation using private variables
  
- Class and Method Design
  
- Max/Min Optimization
  
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 🛠 How to Run

Option 1: With input file

Create a file named `input.txt` with the required input and run:

    python3 scope.py < input.txt

Option 2: Manual input

Just run:

    python3 scope.py
